Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze student quiz performance and provide personalized recommendations to help students improve. The system:

Fetches quiz data from API endpoints.

Analyzes performance by topic, difficulty level, and accuracy.

Identifies weak areas and improvement trends.

Generates visualizations and actionable recommendations.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/ValterSalimo/Personalized-Student-Recommendations/.git
cd personalized-student-recommendations
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Script
Execute the main script to analyze the data and generate recommendations:

bash
Copy
python main.py
Approach
1. Data Fetching
The script fetches quiz data from three API endpoints:

quiz_endpoint_url: Quiz details.

current_quiz_submission_url: Latest quiz submission data.

historical_quiz_data_url: Historical quiz performance data.

2. Data Analysis
Topic-wise Performance: Calculates average accuracy, score, and duration for each topic.

Weak Areas: Identifies topics with the lowest average accuracy.

Improvement Trends: Analyzes trends in accuracy and score over time.

Speed vs. Accuracy: Evaluates the balance between speed and accuracy in the latest quiz.

3. Recommendations
Difficulty Level Recommendations: Suggests appropriate difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Normal) for weak topics.

Personalized Feedback: Provides actionable steps for improving weak areas.

Student Persona: Defines a student persona based on overall performance metrics.

4. Visualizations
Generates and saves the following visualizations:

Topic-wise average accuracy (bar chart).

Accuracy trend over time (line chart).

Quiz score distribution (histogram).

Topic-wise average quiz duration (bar chart).

Weak vs. strong topics comparison (bar chart).

Usage
Run the Script:

Execute the script to fetch data, analyze performance, and generate recommendations.

The script will print insights and recommendations to the console and save visualizations as PNG files.

Customize Input:

Modify the API endpoints in the script to fetch data from your own sources.

Adjust the analysis logic to suit your specific requirements.

View Output:

Insights and recommendations are printed in the console.

Visualizations are saved in the current working directory or a specified folder.

Output
Console Output
Difficulty Level Recommendations: Suggested difficulty levels for weak topics.

Speed vs. Accuracy Analysis: Insights into the balance between speed and accuracy.

Personalized Feedback: Topic-specific and general study recommendations.

Student Persona: A persona based on overall performance.

Visualizations
topic_accuracy_bar_chart.png: Bar chart showing average accuracy per topic.

accuracy_trend_line_chart.png: Line chart showing accuracy trends over time.

quiz_score_distribution_histogram.png: Histogram showing the distribution of quiz scores.

topic_quiz_duration_bar_chart.png: Bar chart showing average quiz duration per topic.

weak_vs_strong_topics_bar_chart.png: Bar chart comparing weak and strong topics.

Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:

requests: For fetching data from API endpoints.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib and seaborn: For generating visualizations.

scikit-learn: For machine learning (if integrated).

Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
